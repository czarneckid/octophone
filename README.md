# octophone

Interact with GitHub pull requests on your phone!

## To-Do List

* Documentation
* Allow for configurable repositories
* Figure out how in the hell to accept any numbered input from Tropo
* File bug on gem for Github API since it seems to require a commit message? Either that or the GitHub API requires it when it says it's optional?
* More specs for the application
